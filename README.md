# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

This is a Machine Learning based model developed in Python for the detection of fraudaulent credit card's transactions.

## Dataset :-

Source :- https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The dataset contains 31 parameters and each parameter is having more than 2 lakhs recorded values. The dataset was loaded using the Pandas library.

Following are the parameters :-

    a) Time : Time of transaction
    b) V1-V28 : V1 to V28 are the results of PCA dimensionality reduction that was used to protect sensitive information in                   this dataset.Like location or name of the user.
    c) Amount : Amount for which transaction was done.
    d) Class : Class 0 represents a fraudaulent transaction and Class 1 represents a genuine transaction.

    For saving computational power and time, we take 10% of the emtire dataset rather than the whole.

### Histogram of each parameter
    Plotted using Matplotlib.

### Correlation Matrix

    It tells the linear relationships between attributes so that unwanted ones can be filtered out and was plotted using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn modules.

## Algorithms

    The algorithms used are Local Outlier Factor and Random Forests. Former one achieved efficiency upto 99.75% and the later one upto 99.65%. They were imported from the Sklearn module.
